	\section{Related work}
	There are several research works on smart irrigation system. Most of them have used microcontrollers and various sensors along with it. R.Nandini, S.Poovizhi and their partners have conducted their research on an automated irrigation system for efficient water management and also they have introduced us with an intruder detection system. For water management, soil parameters like soil moisture, pH, humidity are measured. The intruder detection system is done by a PIR sensor where the birds are prohibited from entering into the field. GSM module has been established to build the communication between the farmer and the field. This system doesn’t really intimidate the farmer, hence, saves man power and time\cite{c1}. Hajar M. Yasin, Subhi R. M. Zeebaree, and Ibrahim M. I. Zebari proposed a irrigation system controlled by the Arduino Mega 2560 and GSM technology. The system uses moisture sensors in soil and a water tank to monitor moisture levels and water availability. The farmer/homeowner can manually control the system through SMS messages to start/stop irrigation and turn on/off the water pump. The system also considers the possibility of an empty water tank and rain, with sensors to detect these conditions and adjust irrigation accordingly\cite{c2}. Wenyan Li proposed a water-saving irrigation system that utilizes solar energy technology and the ZigBee wireless communication system. The system uses a ZigBee wireless sensor network to gather data on soil temperature and moisture, which is then transmitted to a monitor and control server. The administrator of the server can use this information to control the irrigation system. The sensor network is designed for low power consumption and is powered by a lead-acid battery that is charged by a solar cell panel\cite{c3}. Ravikumar, T.Venu Gopal, Sridhar and Nagendra proposed an irrigation technique that monitors the soil’s moisture using microcontroller-based technology. They have conducted the experiments of the project in a Lab view environment by interfacing MyRio software. Along with the moisture of soil, this system also tracks the rainfall, temperature, and humidity which is recorded and maintained in a database as a backup to employ in a further weather prediction formula that helps the farmers with the type of crop to be planted\cite{c4}. Sultana Parween, P.K. Manjhi, Dr. Somnath Sinha have shown the design of automated information system for irrigation using Zigbee. By incorporating all the parameters(soil moisture, humidity, dryness) required for irrigation in farming, the system is basically based on low cost Zigbee coordinator, end devices and router. This proposed system seems to be simple for having no installation hazards and post maintenance complications\cite{c5}. Joaquin Gutierrez along with his other team members built an automated irrigation system to optimize water usage for agricultural crops. It uses a distributed wireless network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. Also, a gateway unit handles sensor information, triggers actuators, and transmits data to a web application. An algorithm was developed with threshold values of temperature and soil moisture that was programmed into a microcontroller-based gateway to control water quantity. The system was powered by photovoltaic panels and had a duplex communication link based on a cellular-Internet interface that allowed for data inspection and irrigation scheduling to be programmed through a web page\cite{c6}.

	\section{System Components}
	\subsection{Soil Moisture Sensor}
	The soil moisture sensor consists of a comparator (LM393) that converts analog data to discrete digital signals. The sensor has two thin copper wires, each 5 cm in length, that can be inserted into the soil under test. The sensor works by measuring the conductivity of the soil, which changes depending on the amount of moisture in the soil. When the probes are inserted into the soil, the soil between the probes acts as a variable resistor, with the resistance changing depending on the moisture content in the soil. This resistance can range from infinity (for completely dry soil) to a very low resistance (for 100\% moisture in soil). The change in resistance across the probes (RS) leads to a change in the forward-bias voltage, which results in a corresponding change in input base current\cite{c7}.

	\subsection{DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor}
	The DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is a commonly used digital sensor that is capable of measuring both temperature and humidity in the surrounding environment. It consists of a humidity sensing component and a thermistor, which measures temperature. The sensor works by converting the analog signal from the thermistor and the humidity sensor to digital signals using a single-wire protocol.
	It has a detection range of 20-90\% relative humidity with an accuracy of ±5\%. It can also measure temperature in the range of 0-50°C with an accuracy of ±2°C. The sensor is relatively low-cost, making it a popular choice for hobbyists and DIY projects\cite{c9}.
	
	\subsection{Wi-Fi Module}
	A Wi-Fi module is a small electronic component that enables wireless connectivity to devices such as computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices. Wi-Fi modules can be interfaced with microcontrollers or single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi or Arduino, allowing for easy integration into various projects.
	
	\subsection{Relay Module}
	A relay module is an electronic device that is used to control high-voltage and high-current circuits using low-voltage and low-current signals. It typically consists of a relay, which is an electromechanical switch, and a driver circuit that provides the necessary signal to control the relay.

	%\section{Introduction}
	%This document is a model and instructions for \LaTeX.
	%Please observe the conference page limits. 
	%
	%\section{Ease of Use}
	%
	%\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}
	%
	%The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
	%column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
	%alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
	%measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
	%and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
	%as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
	%Please do not revise any of the current designations.
	%
	%\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
	%Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
	%separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
	%formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
	%proofreading, spelling and grammar.
	%
	%Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
	%formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
	%for you.
	%
	%\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
	%Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
	%even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
	%IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
	%abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.
	%
	%\subsection{Units}
	%\begin{itemize}
	%\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
	%\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
	%\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
	%\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
	%\end{itemize}
	%
	%\subsection{Equations}
	%Number equations consecutively. To make your 
	%equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
	%appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
	%but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
	%sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
	%sentence, as in:
	%\begin{equation}
	%a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
	%\end{equation}
	%
	%Be sure that the 
	%symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
	%the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
	%the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''
	%
	%\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
	%
	%Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
	%of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
	%to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
	%citations without having to go through the file line by line.
	%
	%Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
	%\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
	%environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
	%
	%Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
	%will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
	%equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
	%article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
	%the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
	%counting.
	%
	%{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
	%data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
	%bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
	%
	%{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
	%subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
	%referenced as Table IV-B3. 
	%
	%{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
	%\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
	%supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
	%cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
	%should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
	%
	%Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
	%will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
	%any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
	%surrounding equation.
	%
	%\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
	%\begin{itemize}
	%\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
	%\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
	%\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
	%\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
	%\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
	%\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
	%\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
	%\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
	%\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
	%\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
	%\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
	%\end{itemize}
	%An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.
	%
	%\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
	%\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
	%minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
	%should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
	%next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
	%and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
	%affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
	%example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
	%
	%\subsection{Identify the Headings}
	%Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
	%your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.
	%
	%Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
	%topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
	%References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
	%``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
	%table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
	%style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
	%down menu to differentiate the head from the text.
	%
	%Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
	%example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
	%material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
	%sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
	%and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
	%should be introduced.
	%
	%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
	%\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
	%bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
	%figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
	%below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
	%figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
	%``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.
	%
	%\begin{table}[htbp]
	%\caption{Table Type Styles}
	%\begin{center}
	%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	%\hline
	%\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
	%\cline{2-4} 
	%\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
	%\hline
	%copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\

	%
	%\begin{figure}[htbp]
	%\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
	%\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
	%\label{fig}
	%\end{figure}
	%
	%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
	%rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
	%avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
	%``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
	%units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
	%with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
	%\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
	%quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
	%``Temperature/K''.
	%
	%\section*{Acknowledgment}
	%
	%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
	%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
	%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
	%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
	%
	%\section*{References}
	%
	%Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
	%sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
	%number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
	%the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''
	%
	%Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
	%the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
	%abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.
	%
	%Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
	%``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
	%submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
	%that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
	%Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
	%element symbols.
	%
	%For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
	%citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
